# BazingaBoard
Welcome to BazingaBoard! This is a repository dedicated to the Bazinga Board from my 7-9 Bible Study Group! It is a 4x5 board that has cards that you get to pick when you get a question right. This cards can either help you (like double your score) or they can hurt you (like take two points from your score and give it to the other team) so you have to choose wisely! This will be a project that takes advantage of arrays in JavaScript to make up the board, and then a random card generator (that will randomly place and pick the cards) using types of JavaScript code (like Objects, if/else statements, etc.). I hope you like this project because I know I will enjoy making it! Thank You for checking out this project and God Bless! :) ---Jonathan Bruce (@JwBZx)
