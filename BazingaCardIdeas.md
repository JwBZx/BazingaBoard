This is the file where I will be storing all of the ideas I have for new Bazinga Cards for the Bazinga Board.
These may or may not go into the final app. I might get the group's (or the people from 7-9's) feedback before putting them in the app.
But anyway these are just some cool ideas I had for cards! :smile:

The cards here will be organized by color (green, orange, pink, and yellow) and also by type (points, teams, and activities).

Look below for the full list of ideas for Bazinga Board cards!
